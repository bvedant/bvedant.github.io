	<h1>I love cars.</h1>

	<p>My interest in cars has lasted since I was in preschool, starting with collecting Hot Wheels to now coding up a data analysis and scraping project with an end goal of using Python libraries to collect and analyze car models and their VINs. People who met me when I was younger would know me as the child who was able to tell the marque and model of a car by its wheels and overall design, from 500 feet away.</p>
	<p>I currently drive a 2018 Mazda3 (with the peppy 2.5L engine) in Sonic Silver Metallic</p>
